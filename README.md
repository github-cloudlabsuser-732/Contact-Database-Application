# Deploying an App with ARM Template and GitHub Actions

This guide will walk you through the process of creating an ARM template to deploy your app and setting up a GitHub Actions pipeline workflow file for automated deployments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Azure subscription
- Azure Resource Group
- GitHub repository

## Step 1: Create an ARM Template

1. Open your favorite text editor or Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template authoring tool.
2. Define the resources you want to deploy in the ARM template, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, or networking resources.
3. Specify the parameters and variables required for your deployment.
4. Save the ARM template with a `.json` extension.

## Step 2: Deploy the App using ARM Template

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to your Azure Resource Group.
3. Click on the "Deployments" tab.
4. Click on the "Add" button to start a new deployment.
5. Select the ARM template file you created in Step 1.
6. Fill in the required parameters and click on the "Review + create" button.
7. Review the deployment settings and click on the "Create" button to start the deployment.

## Step 3: Set up GitHub Actions Pipeline Workflow

1. Open your GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to the "Actions" tab.
3. Click on the "Set up a workflow yourself" button.
4. Create a new YAML file with a `.yml` extension.
5. Define the workflow steps, such as checking out the code, building the app, and deploying using the ARM template.
6. Save the workflow file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.

## Step 4: Trigger Automated Deployments

1. Commit and push your ARM template and workflow file to your GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to the "Actions" tab in your repository.
3. Click on the workflow you created in Step 3.
4. Click on the "Run workflow" button to trigger the deployment.

Congratulations! You have successfully created an ARM template to deploy your app and set up a GitHub Actions pipeline workflow for automated deployments.
